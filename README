MoonPanoramaMaker

Python application for the automatic exposure of moon panoramas

MoonPanoramaMaker automates the process of taking high-resolution panoramas of the Moon. Since the USB cameras employed cover a very small field of view, multiple views must be combined to produce a complete panorama. MoonPanoramaMaker covers the current Moon phase with an optimal grid of single views and automatically steers the telescope mount and camera during their exposure.

This repository contains the source code of MoonPanoramaMaker and its documentation. Under "release" you can download the most recent Windows installer and the complete source code.
